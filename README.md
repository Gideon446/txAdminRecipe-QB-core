# ðŸ§ª txAdminRecipe â€“ The Order of the Sacred Framework

**Description:**
A refined and production-ready **QBCore-based txAdmin recipe**, built and maintained by *The Order of the Sacred Framework*, designed to give your FiveM server a powerful, modern foundation with minimal setup and maximum flexibility.

This recipe includes **out-of-the-box compatibility** with:

* **ox\_inventory**
* **ox\_target**
* **ox\_doorlock**

These resources are fully pre-configured and include **backwards compatibility for legacy QB-style scripts**, allowing you to retain most existing community-made QBCore features without needing rewrites.

## What's Included

This isnâ€™t just a base QBCore recipe â€” itâ€™s an enhanced and opinionated starter stack curated for performance, immersion, and developer ease. Here's what it includes:

* **illineum-appearance** â€” replaces `qb-clothing` with a modern and extensible clothing/character system
* **ox\_lib** â€” included by default and required by many modern resources
* **ac\_scoreboard** â€” replaces `qb-scoreboard` with a modern UI and cleaner implementation
* **um-idcards** â€” immersive and detailed player identification system
* **ps-mdt** and **ps-dispatch** â€” integrated for law enforcement and roleplay tools
* **Patched ps-ui minigames** â€” includes updated versions of ps-ui with fixed cancelation and interaction bugs
* **renewed-weathersync** â€” replaces `qb-weather` for better performance and stability
* **lc\_fuel** â€” replaces legacy fuel with an immersive UI, fuel hoses, and improved handling
* **wasabi\_fishing** â€” a complete, free fishing system for serious or casual RP
* **mana\_hunting** â€” feature-rich hunting system for wilderness gameplay
* **sleepless\_inventory\_addons** â€” supports visual items on player models like weapons on backs
* **lation\_247robbery** â€” a modern, streamlined alternative to the legacy 24/7 robbery system
* **mm\_radio** â€” replaces `qb-radio` with a cleaner, modern interface
* **rpemotes-compatible shops** â€” player shops include emote interactions for added immersion
* **Community Bridge** â€” a shared utility layer powering community-built resources to simplify scripting and reduce duplication
* **Standard QBCore Resources** â€” all other core QBCore files are pulled directly from the official QBCore GitHub repositories for stability and ease of future updates
