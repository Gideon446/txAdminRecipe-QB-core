# 🧪 txAdminRecipe – The Order of the Sacred Framework Edition

**Description:**
A refined and production-ready **QBCore-based txAdmin recipe** built by *The Order of the Sacred Framework*, designed to give your server a solid, modern foundation with minimal setup.

This recipe features **out-of-the-box compatibility** with:

* ✅ **ox\_inventory**
* ✅ **ox\_target**
* ✅ **ox\_doorlock**

All three of these essential resources are **pre-configured** and include **built-in backwards compatibility for QB-style scripts**, allowing you to continue using most community-made QBCore resources without modification.

In addition, this recipe integrates our powerful **Community Bridge**, a shared utility layer that simplifies development and cross-resource support. Several community-created tools and scripts using this bridge are bundled for free, giving your server a head start with production-quality features from day one.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This recipe is **not currently listed** in the default txAdmin recipe browser. You must use the **Remote URL** option when creating a new server.
